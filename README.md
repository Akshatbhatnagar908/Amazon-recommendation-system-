# Amazon Product Recommendation System (Content-Based & BoW)

## Overview
This project implements a **content-based recommendation system** for Amazon products using **Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and cosine similarity**. The system analyzes product descriptions, brands, colors, and other metadata to provide relevant recommendations.

## Features
- **Data Processing** â€“ Cleans and structures product data for analysis.
- **Bag of Words (BoW) & TF-IDF** â€“ Converts textual product descriptions into numerical representations.
- **Cosine Similarity** â€“ Measures product relevance to generate recommendations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Analyzes brands, colors, and pricing trends.
- **Visualization** â€“ Uses Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for insights.
- **Web Scraping** â€“ Integrates BeautifulSoup for data extraction.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, BeautifulSoup
